# MET Web

<h2> Web created with React using the MET Museum API. This website is a catalog to explore the artworks of the MET museum. They can be filtered by size, time, type of work, style, author, room, etc. </h2>

This project allows you to explore all of the MET Museum's works of art in a comfortable, interesting and beautiful way.
To make this a less conventional experience we sought to create new ways to navigate the data with innovative interfaces.

- You can browse the gallery and use all kinds of filters to find the pieces that interest you the most.
- You can take a trip through history and see the most important works of each period.
- You can get lost in the map of the museum and go to rooms dedicated to a particular type of art.
- You can also let us advise you with the random function that constantly shows you random works of art until one of them catches your eye.
